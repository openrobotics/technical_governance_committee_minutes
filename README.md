# Minutes of the Technical Governance Committee of the OSRA

This repository contains the *approved* minutes of past meetings of the [Open Source Robotics Alliance](https://osralliance.org/)'s Technical Governance Committee (TGC).
For full details of the functioning of the TGC, see the [OSRA Charter]() and the OSRA's [Technical Governance Policies and Procedures](https://github.com/openrobotics/osra-policies-and-procedures/blob/main/technical_governance_policies_and_procedures.md).
Quoting the P&P:

> The TGC is responsible for overseeing the Project Management Committees, ensuring that each Project is managed appropriately with respect to the Project's goals and the OSRF's goals.
> In addition, the TGC is expected to undertake technical activities to improve the operation of all Projects.

The TGC typically meets once per month, although it may have additional meetings from time to time, and may also skip a month if an unavoidable conflict arises.
(The P&P requires a meeting at least once every calendar quarter.)
Minutes are taken of each meeting, and circulated to the members of the TGC for confirmation.
These minutes are then approved in the next regular TGC meeting.
Once minutes are approved, they are added to this repository for public record keeping.

The TGC's meetings operate following [Robert's Rules of Order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert%27s_Rules_of_Order#Corporations) and the [Chatham House Rule](https://www.chathamhouse.org/about-us/chatham-house-rule).
This means that the minutes will not contain a detailed transcript of the meeting's conversations, nor will they state the individual opinions and positions of TGC members.
The minutes are instead intended to be a record of what was discussed and what decisions were formally taken.
